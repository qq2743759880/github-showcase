# Style System

## Design Intent

Create analytical, executive-ready visuals with institutional restraint. The visual should make a strategic point quickly, then reward a second read with clear data structure.

## Design Tokens

The renderer (`scripts/render_slide_spec.py`) and this document share one set of tokens. If a value changes, change it in both places in the same commit — a spec that cannot be reproduced from this document is a bug.

| Token | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | 1280 x 720 (16:9) | The only canvas the renderer produces; other canvases are spec-only |
| Grid unit | 8 px | Margins and fixed anchors sit on multiples of 8; chart geometry is data-driven |
| Margins | 80 px left and right | `ML` / `MR` |
| Headline baseline | y = 96 | First headline line |
| Chart band | y = 208 to 560 | `CHART_TOP` / `CHART_BOTTOM` |
| Annotation baseline | y = 630 | Footer takeaway line |
| Source baseline | y = 692 | Source note and page number |

## Palette

Colors are derived, not copied from a framework default. The primary accent is deliberately darker than a typical UI blue so that a rung-1 solid fill remains distinguishable from dark-grey body text after greyscale conversion (relative-luminance ratio at least 1.5 — asserted in the renderer's test suite). One navy serves both content accents and cover backgrounds; two unrelated navies in one system is drift, not hierarchy.

### Content Slides

| Role | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Background | `#FFFFFF` |
| Primary text | `#000000` |
| Primary accent (single navy) | `#15296B` |
| Secondary accent | `#2563EB` |
| Dark grey | `#374151` |
| Medium grey | `#6B7280` |
| Border grey | `#D1D5DB` |
| Light fill | `#F3F4F6` |
| Light accent tint | `#EFF3FB` |
| Risk accent, sparingly | `#B91C1C` |

### Cover Slides

| Role | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Background (same navy as primary accent) | `#15296B` |
| Primary text | `#FFFFFF` |
| Secondary text | `#E5E7EB` |

There is no metallic or gold accent. A gold-on-navy "premium" flourish is the kind of template cliché this system's own anti-pattern list forbids; restraint is the premium signal.

### Greyscale and Color-Vision Survival

- Meaning must never depend on hue alone (this repeats the quality-rubric blocking gate). Every colored mark carries a direct label, sign, or position that says the same thing.
- The primary accent and dark grey must stay separable in greyscale print. The current pair (`#15296B` vs `#374151`) passes; test any replacement.
- In waterfalls, positive (blue) and negative (red) bars also differ by sign prefix on the value label, so monochrome copies still read correctly.

## Emphasis Hierarchy

Emphasis has a ranked strength order. Apply it deliberately, never on a whim — undisciplined highlighting is the most common cause of cluttered, low-hierarchy slides. Memorize the order as **fill > line > text**: a filled shape outranks a bordered one, and a border outranks styled text. Pick rungs from the top down only as far as the message needs, and reserve the strongest rung for the single element that carries the takeaway.

| Rung | Technique | Tokens | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (strongest) | Solid fill, reversed text | fill `#15296B`, text `#FFFFFF` | The one box that states the conclusion or focus zone |
| 2 | Tinted fill, accent text | fill `#F3F4F6` or `#EFF3FB`, text `#15296B` | A secondary highlighted block or grouping |
| 3 | Outline only | border `#15296B`, fill `#FFFFFF`, text `#15296B` | A called-out item that should not dominate |
| 4 | Accent-colored text | text `#2563EB` | Keywords and key numbers inline |
| 5 | Bold text | text `#000000`, bold | Sub-labels and minor headings |
| Baseline | Body | text `#000000`, regular | Everything else |

Discipline rules:

- Cap strong emphasis (rungs 1-2) at one element per visual, two only when the message genuinely has two anchors. If everything is emphasized, nothing is.
- Do not stack rungs on the same element. A solid fill already wins; adding colored and bold text on top only adds noise.
- Keep each rung's meaning consistent across a deck so the reader learns the code instead of re-decoding every slide.
- The red risk accent (`#B91C1C`) is orthogonal to this ladder. It marks negative variance or risk, not strength of emphasis, so it never substitutes for a rung.

## Typography

Typefaces are named, not left to fallback chance.

- Headline serif: **Georgia** (fallback: Times New Roman; Japanese: Hiragino Mincho ProN, Yu Mincho). This is a deliberate choice, not a shrug — distributable strategy-consulting templates substitute Georgia for their licensed brand serifs, so Georgia is the accurate portable equivalent.
- Body sans: **Helvetica Neue** (fallbacks: Helvetica, Arial; Japanese: Hiragino Sans, Yu Gothic, Noto Sans JP, Meiryo). The CJK fallbacks are part of the stack, not an afterthought — outputs must render on machines without Latin-only fonts. System Japanese faces come before Noto Sans JP deliberately: a partial Noto install (commonly Black weight only) listed first would set body text ultra-bold.

Type sizes are fixed tokens (px on the 1280x720 canvas, defined once as module constants in `scripts/render_slide_spec.py` and used everywhere — no renderer hardcodes a text-role size literal), not ranges, and they form a **ratio**, not a grab-bag: headline : body : chrome runs roughly **4 : 1.6 : 1** across a slide's full span, reading text (bullets, claims, labels, values) has a hard **floor of 18px** so it survives projection and screen-share, and chrome (source notes, footnotes, page numbers, classification markers) stays deliberately smallest on purpose — never raise it to "balance" a slide.

| Token | Size | Weight | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `T_COVER_TITLE` | 54 | regular serif | Cover / end-cover title |
| `T_DIVIDER_TITLE` | 48 | regular serif | Section-divider title |
| `T_HEADLINE` | 40 | bold serif | Content headline, up to 2 lines |
| `T_HEADLINE_DENSE` | 32 | bold serif | Content headline, 3 lines |
| `T_STATEMENT` | 32 | regular serif | Quote text; KPI-like big statements |
| `T_KPI_NUM` | 44 | bold | `kpi_scorecard` hero numbers |
| `T_SUBLINE` | 20 | regular | Headline subline; cover/divider subtitle |
| `T_BODY` | 22 | bold/semibold | Bullets, claims, takeaways, actions, agenda item titles, process step titles, benchmark row labels |
| `T_LABEL` | 18 | regular to semibold | Reading floor: sub-bullets, proofs/implications, agenda details, owner-timing metas, chart category/axis/value labels, gantt row labels, small-multiples labels, rail items |
| `T_NUM_AGENDA` | 28 | serif navy | Agenda numbers |
| `T_NUM_CLOSING` | 26 | serif navy | Closing takeaway numbers |
| `T_TICK` | 14 | regular | Axis ticks, min/max range numerals, funnel conversion %; heatmap/benchmark cell values may sit between this and `T_LABEL` in a tight grid, never below it |
| `T_KICKER_LABEL` | 15 | semibold, letter-spaced | Structural small-caps labels: `SECTION NN`, `KEY TAKEAWAYS`, `NEXT STEPS` |
| `T_ANNOTATION` | 22 | semibold | Footer takeaway/annotation line |
| `T_CHROME` | 13 | regular | Source line, footnotes, page number, classification — smallest text on the slide, by design |

Ratio check: `T_HEADLINE / T_BODY` = 1.8 (≥ 1.7), `T_BODY / T_CHROME` = 1.7 (≥ 1.6), deck span `T_COVER_TITLE / T_CHROME` ≈ 4.2. A change that breaks either ratio is wrong, whatever it does for a single slide in isolation. This is a general projection-readability practice — sized for a room, not a monitor two feet away — not a house style borrowed from any one firm.

### Japanese Typography

- Use the sans stack for body and labels; the mincho fallbacks are for headlines only.
- Line feed: CJK body text needs looser leading than Latin — use 1.75-1.8x line height where Latin uses ~1.5x.
- The renderer wraps CJK text per character (no spaces needed) and measures fullwidth characters as double width; do not pre-break Japanese strings.
- Break lines at meaning boundaries when hand-tuning (bunsetsu), never mid-word for katakana loanwords.
- Closing punctuation (。、）」…) never starts a line: the renderer's `wrap()` applies line-start kinsoku automatically by hanging the punctuation off the previous line (ぶら下がり組). When hand-tuning outside the renderer, do the same or pull the preceding character down.

## Canvas Formats

The default canvas is a 16:9 landscape slide, but the system adapts to other deliverables. Pick the canvas from the document profile in `references/document-type-profiles.md`.

| Canvas | Renderer | Use For | Adjustments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16:9 landscape | ✓ SVG | Slides, decks, steering materials | Default rules apply |
| A4 / Letter portrait | spec-only | Reports, memos, whitepapers, one-pagers | Smaller headlines, numbered figures, figures sized to text column |
| Vertical 4:5 or 9:16 | spec-only | Infographics, public explainers | Larger type, lower density, top-to-bottom narrative |
| Square 1:1 | spec-only | Compact summaries, social-format cards | One message, one visual, one annotation |
| Inline figure | spec-only | Technical docs, README diagrams | Flexible width, diagram-as-code friendly, no decorative framing |

The bundled renderer produces the 16:9 canvas only. For other canvases the skill delivers a spec or image-generation prompt; say so explicitly in the deliverable.

Across all canvases the constants are: insight-led headline, honest scales, restrained palette, direct labels, and explicit assumptions.

## Layout

- Default canvas: 16:9 landscape.
- Keep outer margins generous enough for projection and screenshots.
- Use a clear top-down reading order: headline, visual body, annotations, source notes.
- Use hairline rules for tables and dividers.
- Keep dense information organized into grid columns, aligned labels, and consistent numeric formats.
- Use whitespace to separate logical groups, not to create decorative emptiness.

## Chart Rules

- Scale axes honestly; do not exaggerate small changes with cropped baselines unless the axis choice is disclosed.
- Mark the zero baseline with an explicit "0" tick so the reader can verify it, not just trust it.
- Align comparable numbers to the same baseline.
- Label important values directly when possible; avoid legend hunting. Direct labels on the first instance replace legend swatches.
- Use blue for the main argument and grey for context.
- Use red only for negative variance, risk, or loss.
- Signed data (variance, deviation, YoY) in heatmaps uses a diverging ramp anchored at zero, never a single-hue ramp.
- Truncated text shows an ellipsis (…) and keeps the full string in a `<title>` element; nothing is cut silently.
- Add source notes when the user provides sources or when assumptions are material.
- Board-facing slides carry their furniture: page number, classification marker, and numbered footnotes where claims need them.
- Bars, cards, and boxes are flat fill, never fill-plus-border. `GREY_FILL` context bars/steps (`gap`, `before_after`'s "before" bar, `distribution`, `gantt`, `process_flow`) and KPI-scorecard cards carry no `GREY_BORDER` stroke — the fill/no-fill (and blue/grey) contrast alone marks emphasis vs. context; a border adds a second, redundant signal for the same distinction. The two_by_two plot frame is the one exception, since that hairline is the axis itself, not a card outline.
- Multi-column layouts (`summary_strip`) separate columns with equal inner margins (whitespace), never a vertical rule — the same principle `closing`'s two-column layout already follows.
- Every text-list pattern's content sits directly under the text (or subhead) that introduces it — `summary_strip`'s subhead, `closing`'s `KEY TAKEAWAYS`/`NEXT STEPS` labels, and `bullet_list`'s headline all function as the immediate label for the band beneath them, and the first line of content anchors to a fixed offset below that label (`band_start`), never centered away from it. This is a **one-step** rule: `y = band_start` (or, for multi-item lists, `y = row_top` where `row_top = band_start + i * row_h` and `row_h = (CHART_BOTTOM - band_start) / len(items)`, the same "divide the band into one row per item" technique `render_agenda`/`render_gap` use). Do **not** add a second centering step that nudges an item — or a whole short list — further down within its row or band. That second step is exactly what caused two regressions in the same slot: whole-block centering (round 2) pushed item 1 away from its label by however much slack a short list left (a 3-item `closing` list measured a 142px gap between `KEY TAKEAWAYS` and item 1); centering *within* a row (round 3, the fix for that) degenerated back to the identical bug whenever a row was most of the band — a 1-item `bullet_list` or 1-item `closing` column left 148-154px of dead air above the item. `band_start` is `CHART_TOP + 34` for `closing`, `CHART_TOP + 20` for `bullet_list` and `summary_strip`. Leftover space from a short list always collects after the last item, right before the footer — never distributed as a gap above item 1 or inside a row. `process_flow`'s box is the one exception (see below): it has no preceding label to anchor under, so centering it as a block between `CHART_TOP` and `CHART_BOTTOM` (via `_center_block_start`, or the equivalent `(CHART_TOP+CHART_BOTTOM)/2 - box_h/2` process_flow uses directly) is safe. `_center_block_start` is currently unused by any renderer but is kept, tested, as that helper for a future no-label pattern.

## Structural Slides

Six patterns are deck furniture rather than charts (see `references/visualization-patterns.md` → Structural / Deck Patterns): `cover`, `section_divider`, `end_cover`, `agenda`, `bullet_list`, `closing`, `quote`. They split into the two chrome families below; the renderer's `CHROMELESS = {"cover", "section_divider", "end_cover"}` set is the single source for which family a pattern belongs to.

### Navy Family (chromeless, full-bleed)

`cover`, `section_divider`, `end_cover` bypass the standard header/footer chrome entirely. None of the three carries a decorative mark: the navy field, the type, and the ML anchor are the family's whole identity.

- **`section_divider`** (小扉): small-caps label `SECTION 02`-style (`T_KICKER_LABEL` 15, `#E5E7EB`, letter-spaced) above the title; title `T_DIVIDER_TITLE` 48 white serif, wrap 33 units, max 2 lines; subtitle `T_SUBLINE` 20 `#E5E7EB`. Optional `sections` rail near y≈600: horizontal `NN Title` items in `T_LABEL` 18 — the current section (index = `section_number` − 1) solid white weight 600, all others `#E5E7EB` at 55% opacity. The rail is skipped, not compressed, if it would overflow the ML..W-MR margins. Required: `title`, `section_number` (integer ≥ 1).
- **`end_cover`** (裏表紙): mirrors the `cover` geometry — `T_COVER_TITLE` 54 serif title (defaults to "Thank you" when omitted), subtitle `T_SUBLINE` 20 `#E5E7EB`. Up to four `contact` lines (`T_LABEL` 18 `#E5E7EB`, 29px leading) start at y=560; presenter/date meta and the classification marker sit in the same slots as `cover` (y=640). Every field is optional — a bare `{"pattern": "end_cover"}` must still render.

### White Content Family (standard chrome)

`agenda`, `bullet_list`, `closing`, `quote` keep the standard header/footer chrome; `headline` drives the header exactly like a chart slide, so the insight-headline discipline still applies even though there is no chart underneath it.

- **`agenda`**: 1–8 rows on hairlines (`GREY_BORDER`), starting at `CHART_TOP` and filling the chart band. `01`-style `T_NUM_AGENDA` 28 navy serif row numbers at ML; title `T_BODY` 22 weight 600 black; `detail` `T_LABEL` 18 `GREY_MED`, either at x = ML+320 or beneath the title when the detail text is long — pick one placement and hold it for the whole deck. More than 6 items splits into two columns (4+4) at the same row height; more than 8 is a spec error, not a smaller row height. At most one row takes rung-2 emphasis via `current` (`BLUE_TINT` fill behind the row, title in `BLUE`).
- **`bullet_list`** (action-title text slide): 1–6 top-level bullets — a 7th is a sign the slide should split in two, so 7+ is a spec error, never smaller type. Marker: a 6×6 navy square at the text baseline; text `T_BODY` 22 black, wrapped to the column width, 30px leading. Each bullet may carry 0–3 `sub` items: en-dash marker, `T_LABEL` 18 `GREY_DARK`, indented 24px, 24px leading. `columns: 2` splits the bullets into two equal columns, each dividing its own share of the chart band into one row per bullet (`row_h = (CHART_BOTTOM - band_start) / len(column_bullets)`, `band_start = CHART_TOP + 20`) and anchoring each bullet's text block (base line(s) + subs) to its row's top edge (`y = row_top`, no further centering within the row) — the same technique `render_gap` uses, so a short list still fills the column edge to edge instead of leaving one dead gap above the footer, and item 1 always sits at `band_start` regardless of bullet count. At most one bullet may set `emphasis: true`, rendered as weight 600 + rung-4 `BLUE` text — the one sanctioned exception to the "do not stack rungs" rule below, reserved for a single inline sentence, never a filled block.
- **`closing`** (key takeaways / next steps): with `takeaways` (1–4) present, two columns — left (~45% width) carries the `KEY TAKEAWAYS` label (`T_KICKER_LABEL` 15, `GREY_MED`, letter-spaced), `T_NUM_CLOSING` 26 numbered serif navy digits, and `T_BODY` 22 text; right carries the `NEXT STEPS` label with `action` `T_BODY` 22 weight 600 and "Owner · Timing" `T_LABEL` 18 `GREY_MED` on a second line. Each label stays pinned at `CHART_TOP`; the list beneath it divides `[CHART_TOP + 34, CHART_BOTTOM]` into one row per item, independently per column since takeaways and next-steps counts (and per-item heights) can differ, and anchors each item's text block to its row's top edge (`y = row_top`, same technique as `bullet_list`, no further centering within the row) — item 1 always sits at `band_start` directly under its label regardless of how many items follow, and the band still fills edge to edge for a short list. Without `takeaways`, 1–5 `next_steps` rows (each requiring `action`) run full width on hairlines with owner/timing right-aligned at W-MR. `call_to_action` renders through the existing footer annotation slot (blue, weight 600) — it reuses that mechanism rather than introducing a new motif.
- **`quote`**: one oversized opening quotation mark (serif 103, decorative — not a reading role, scaled with `T_STATEMENT`; `BLUE_TINT` fill) above-left of the block — the single structural motif this pattern gets, and it never gets a matching closing mark. Quote text `T_STATEMENT` 32 black serif, wrap 50 units, max 4 lines, left-aligned starting at x = ML+60; attribution `T_LABEL` 18 `GREY_DARK` weight 600 prefixed with an em-dash; `context` `T_LABEL` 18 `GREY_MED` below it.

### Deck Arc

The conventional shape a full deck follows: `cover` → `agenda` → content slides (with `section_divider` marking each act boundary) → `closing` → `end_cover`. Not every deck needs every structural pattern, but a `section_divider` with no corresponding `agenda` entry, or a `closing` with no `cover`, reads as an unfinished deck rather than a deliberate one.

## Document Layer (HTML outputs)

The four HTML builders (deck, report, article, speaker script) share one
design system with the slides. Tokens, so nothing drifts:

| Token | Value | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading measure | 720px max-width for body text | report, article prose |
| Column | report 820px (1220px with sticky TOC rail), article ~980px slides, script 1160px | per builder |
| Body text | 16px, line-height 1.7 (en) / 1.9 + `palt` (ja) | report, article |
| Script narration | 20px screen / ~13.5pt print, ja 1.9 | speaker script |
| Title band | navy `#15296B`, serif title, meta in `#E5E7EB`-class light text | all covers/bands |
| Rules | hairline `#D1D5DB`, strong `#9CA3AF`; no boxes, no shadows, no radius, no accent bars | all |
| Exhibit/slide frames | hairline top+bottom, never a full border box | report, article, script |
| List markers | 6px navy square (nested: 5px grey) | report, article |
| Links | `#2563EB`, underline as a soft bottom border | report, article |
| TOC | hairline band; sticky right rail ≥1240px with scroll tracking | report, article |
| Print | report/article A4 portrait; script A4 landscape (slide left, narration right); deck 16:9 pages | per builder |

Layout rules that repeat across builders: text on the measure, evidence
(slides, tables) on the full column; section rhythm from hairlines and
whitespace; chrome (sources, page numbers, classification) stays smallest;
the Japanese sans stack always lists system faces before Noto Sans JP.

## Word Budget

Slides carry claims; prose belongs in the report mode. When text does not
fit, the fix is fewer words or another slide — never smaller type (the type
tokens are floors, not suggestions).

- Headline: one proposition, target 40 half-width units or less (about 20
  Japanese characters). Never two claims joined by a conjunction.
- Bullets, takeaways, next-step actions: aim for one line at body size; two
  lines is the ceiling. Sub-bullets: one line.
- summary_strip: proof and implication each two lines or less at column width.
- Agenda details, owner/timing metas: a phrase, not a sentence.

## Ink Discipline

Every mark must carry information (data-ink rule) — with no exceptions. There is no sanctioned decorative motif: the navy "kicker" bar that used to sit above every headline carried no information and was removed (2026-08-03); the headline itself anchors the slide, and hierarchy comes from typography and position alone. Concretely, this rules out: any decorative bar, horizontal or vertical (a kicker stroke above a headline, a colored left-edge accent bar on a KPI card — `kpi_scorecard` reads status through the trend text color instead); a vertical divider line between `summary_strip` columns (whitespace does that job); and a `GREY_BORDER` stroke paired with a `GREY_FILL` fill on any bar or box (`gap`, `before_after`, `distribution`, `gantt`, `process_flow` — see Chart Rules).

## Anti-Patterns

- Neon, pastel, or startup-style palettes — including gold-on-navy "premium" accents.
- Gradients on analytical content slides.
- Decorative icons that do not encode meaning.
- Any decorative bar: a horizontal "kicker" stroke above a headline, or a left-edge accent bar / colored border on a card, tile, or panel. Bars that carry no data are template filler in any orientation.
- A vertical rule between the columns of a multi-column layout where equal whitespace would separate them just as clearly.
- Legend swatches where a direct label would do.
- Generic descriptive titles such as "Revenue Chart" or "Market Comparison".
- Tiny labels that will not survive export or screen sharing.
- Faux affiliation language with named consulting firms.

### Summary metrics

A `summary_strip` block may include a short `metric` string, such as `"+50%"` or `"60%"`. It renders above the claim at `T_KPI_NUM` on a shared baseline. If any block has a metric, all columns reserve the same space. Keep claims and supporting copy short; the metric must fit the column without reducing its type size. Values that exceed the estimated column width are rejected. Omit `metric` for the original text-only layout.

### Executive presentation theme

Set `"theme": "executive"` consistently across a business deck. Content and cover headings use the existing sans-serif stack at the same readable sizes. Waterfall opening balances and intermediate drivers use neutral greys; the closing balance uses navy, and losses retain their red fill and signed labels. Comparison tables use taller rows, larger values when space allows, subtle alternating row fills, and bold navy leaders instead of multiple solid highlight boxes. Executive comparison tables allow up to five alternatives and six criteria; split larger comparisons across slides to preserve readable rows and headers. Values and chart geometry remain data-driven.

For a `summary_strip`, optional `"focus_block": 2` highlights the third column with a light panel, a thin navy top rule, and a navy metric in the executive theme. The classic theme retains navy fill and reversed text. Choose the one block that carries the decision, rather than highlighting every positive result. Other metrics become black. Dense focused blocks fail validation instead of drawing outside their panel. `focus_block` is a zero-based integer; omit it for the open-column layout. Omit `theme` or use `"classic"` for the original serif presentation style.


### Editable executive diagrams

- `process_flow`: use up to five steps. Each step supports `label`, `detail`, and optional `owner` and `duration`. A single `highlight` identifies the bottleneck or decision point. Keep labels to two lines, details to three, and owner/duration to two; longer content requests a shorter label or a separate slide.
- `two_by_two`: use up to six points. Numbered markers map to a separate label key so names do not sit on top of the plot. Coordinates remain on the 0–100 scale. Optional `focus_quadrant` is zero-based: 0 upper left, 1 upper right, 2 lower left, 3 lower right. Use it only when the highlighted quadrant has a clear business meaning.
- `gantt`: notes appear inside their bars. Shorten notes that do not fit, or move them to the slide annotation. Use the highlight to identify the critical workstream.

The homepage diagram starters provide an SVG preview, an editable JSON file, and a copyable rendering command. Place the downloaded JSON in the installed skill directory before running that command.

## Reference-led analytical and report layouts

When an actual reference is supplied, its publication and page determine the design target. Follow `references/reference-reproduction.md` and inspect the source before choosing a theme. The defaults above are fallback choices, not universal firm rules.

Optional `layout: analytical` gives content slides a 32px sans-serif assertion headline, a separate `exhibit_label`, and a scope/period `subline`. Optional palettes `navy`, `red`, `green`, and `mono` replace the primary and secondary series accents. For signed charts, preserve a distinct meaning for adverse values and avoid using the same hue for selection and loss.

Distribution charts may use `commentary` with a title and one to three concise points. Geometry is recalculated for the smaller plot; chart text is not scaled down. Other chart families do not yet support this rail. Compact report exhibits export chart geometry without slide chrome, leaving captions and provenance editable in the document. See the reproduction workflow for limits and the reference-layout templates for working examples.

### Graphic finishing checks

Review generated slides at full size and in their final document. Executive columns and waterfall bars cap at 88px; gap and funnel bands cap at 28px. These caps reduce visual weight without changing the quantitative axis. Keep category centers, value heights, units and zero baselines intact. Do not apply thin categorical columns blindly to continuous histograms.

Executive process diagrams use open columns, a thin top rule, and a light panel for the one highlighted step. Check the longest label and owner line at actual export size. Inspect number placement on short funnel bars; values sit outside executive bars. Compare all narrative claims to the underlying arithmetic before publication.
